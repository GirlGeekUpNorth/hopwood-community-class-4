    <h1>Princess Isabelle & Prince Jaxon</h1>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a Princess Isabelle. She has a blue dress and a yellow crown. One day, Princess Isabelle found a Prince. The Prince was small but handsome. Isabelle said to the Prince, "I like your clothes". The Prince said, "Thank you, my name is Jaxon, and I like your crown". Then Princess Isabelle and Prince Jaxon got married. Unfortunately, they did not live happily ever after because Princess Isabelle realised she was a strong, independent woman who could do better. Except, a few years later she changed her mind and they got married again and lived happily ever after.</p>
